# üêî Flappy Chicken Game

A fun HTML5 Canvas-based game inspired by Flappy Bird, featuring a cute chicken character!

## üéÆ How to Play (IMPORTANT!)

**This is a physics-based game - you must keep clicking to stay airborne!**

1. **Start**: Click anywhere on the canvas or press SPACE to begin
2. **Keep Flying**: **CONTINUOUSLY** click or press SPACE to make the chicken flap
3. **Don't Stop**: The chicken will fall due to gravity if you stop clicking
4. **Navigate**: Guide the chicken through gaps between green pipes
5. **Score**: Each pipe you pass through increases your score
6. **Avoid**: Don't hit the pipes, ground, or ceiling!

## üïπÔ∏è Game Physics

- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
- Attempts to load random chicken images from online APIs
- Falls back to a beautiful hand-drawn SVG chicken if online images fail
- Smooth 60fps gameplay with requestAnimationFrame
- Physics simulation with gravity and momentum

## üéØ Playing Tips

- **Keep Clicking**: Click every 0.5-1 seconds to maintain altitude
- **Find Your Rhythm**: Develop a steady clicking pattern
- **Don't Panic**: Smooth, regular clicks work better than frantic tapping
- **Look Ahead**: Watch upcoming pipes to time your movements
